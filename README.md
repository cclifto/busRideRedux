#Bus Ride Redux is the creation of Conner Clifton.

This project is an open-source role-playing game engine. Most of the necessary mechanics are in place to move the game forward. Everything else is styling and flash that can be altered by the player if you so choose. The scripts are kept in "textandchoices.js" and "enemies.js". Any additional enemy or event functions must be placed in "action.js".

I love creating things and I think most people are capable of using their imagination more than they give themselves credit for. My goal with making this engine was for people to test their own creative limits and make something that they can be proud of.

In the near future, I'm hoping to create an additional tutorial so that even people with absolutely no coding experience can create their own games.


Above all, I hope you all have fun playing this game. I'm always open to any feedback or suggestions. If you see a grammatical or spelling error, you want to suggest a plot point, or you just want to say "hi", drop me a line at cliftonconner@gmail.com.
